# Trelent take-home

TrelentGPT is a fully responsive, multi-session chat webapp that connects each individual chat session to OpenAI's ChatGPT and allows a user (under the preset name Stanley (Tucci)) to interact with the ChatGPT (3.5 Turbo) assistant in streaming mode, rather than regular post mode. Responses from the assistant are rendered as formatted markup where possible (including lists, font weights, tables etc).

The assistant reponds in-session with live 'typed' responses. The app features an alternate dark mode appearance scheme (with custom switcher) and custom-built overlay components.
